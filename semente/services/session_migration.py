"""Incremental session-state migration.

Old persisted sessions carry states written by earlier versions of the
schema. Instead of crashing (or silently misbehaving) on them, the
``migrate_session_state`` entrypoint walks a version-stamped registry of
migrations and upgrades any state to ``CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION``.

External interface:
    migrate_session_state  -- called at the top of the onboarding gate.
